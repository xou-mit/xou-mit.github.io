Hello there! 

I am an observational astronomer in training. My work at MIT focuses on studying the Galaxy using stellar kinematics and chemistry as a student co-advised by Professors Lina Necib and Anna Frebel. Working with Professor Lina Necib, I study the formation history and global properties of the Milky Way (MW) using observational data from large public surveys like Gaia. With Professor Anna Frebel, I use high-resolution stellar spectroscopy to study the chemical evolution and morphology of individual components in the Galaxy. My work tackles the Galaxy from multiple angles and compares observation with simulation.
